== RENAT environment ==
When test case or suite is executed, RENAT library is used by this order from
  - 1. the variable RENAT_PATH defined in each test case `renat.rc`
  - 2. the variable RENAT_PATH defined in suite case `renat.rc`
  - 3. the environment variable RENAT_PATH for current user


== Running the tests ==
A test case could be run separely by `run.sh` in its folder. A test suite could be run by its `run.sh`.
In this case, test cases insides the suite will be run by in order of case's alphabet name.

A test case could be ignored in suite run by having a file `.ignore` in its folder
